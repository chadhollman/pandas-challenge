Analysis Summary:

In this analysis, I gathered a school districts budgets and test scores and broke those metrics down by each school's individual performance.
I further identified the highest and lowest performing scores by passing rate and compared each school's scoring with their size, school type (district vs charter), and spending per student.
I also broke down passing rates by grade.

Conclusions:
Based off the results from this analysis, we can conclude that:
A) increasing the spending rates per student did not improve their testing scores
B) test scores dropped significantly once schools entered the 2000-5000 student range
C) charter schools accounted for all of the top 5 performing schools, while district schools accounted for the bottom 5
D) district schools performed significantly worse in their math testing scores compared to charter schools
